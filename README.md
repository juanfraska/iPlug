# iPlug

This repository will include all codes we using for our iPlug project. You can have a look at the project in the following link: http://www.instructables.com/id/IPlug/ 

In this repo, we have the ESP8266 code, the Node.js server and the PCB files (optional). Also, there are some
current sensor tests.
